## About Me

I'm a beginner Python developer. I started my career as a embedded developer and created software on C for different small devices and measurement systems, wrote Python scripts for analize measurement results. Now I still work in this sphere as a self-employed and I'm going to change it to web-development.

I'm looking for a job in backed-development and work on improving my skills in this area. But I also interested in frontend development and other related to web-developments skills and tools. So self-education is important part of my life.

I am responsible, I work well in a team and can organize my working time. I like master new skills and always try to find common language with any project members. The result of my work: new app or new app feature that works and does something usefull is a real pleasure for me.

## Code Examples

### Python

LeetCode: [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        end_node = head
        prev_node = head
        for _ in range(n):
            end_node = end_node.next

        if not end_node:
            return head.next

        while end_node.next:
            end_node = end_node.next
            prev_node = prev_node.next

        prev_node.next = prev_node.next.next
        return head
```

### JavaScript

Codewars: [RGB To Hex Conversion](https://www.codewars.com/kata/513e08acc600c94f01000001/train/javascript)

```javascript
function rgb(r, g, b) {
  const constrain = (color) => {
    if (color < 0) return 0;
    if (color > 255) return 255;
    return color;
  };

  const toHex = (color) => {
    let hex = constrain(color).toString(16).toUpperCase();
    if (hex.length < 2) hex = "0" + hex;
    return hex;
  };

  return toHex(r) + toHex(g) + toHex(b);
}
```

### C

Filter function for digital measurements processing

```c
/**
 * @brief Runing average by 2 points.
 * You can adjust the filtering sharpness through the corresponding
 * argument field RunningAverageCoeff.
 * The measurement frequency greatly influences on the results.
 *
 * @param Signal - link to the RuningAverFilterStruct struct
 */
void RuningAverFilterHandler(RuningAverFilterStruct *Signal)
{
    Signal->SampleFreqCount++;
    if (Signal->SampleFreqCount >= Signal->SampleFreq)
    {
        Signal->SampleFreqCount = 0;
        Signal->Out = (Signal->Value - Signal->Out) * Signal->RunAverCoef + Signal->Out;
    }
    Signal->Filtered = 1;
}
```
