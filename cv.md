## About Me

I'm a beginner Python developer. I started my career as a embedded developer and created software on C for different small devices and measurement systems, wrote Python scripts for analize measurement results. Now I still work in this sphere as a self-employed and I'm going to change it to web-development.

I'm looking for a job in backed-development and work on improving my skills in this area. But I also interested in frontend development and other related to web-developments skills and tools. So self-education is important part of my life.

I am responsible, I work well in a team and can organize my working time. I like master new skills and always try to find common language with any project members. The result of my work: new app or new app feature that works and does something usefull is a real pleasure for me.
